            </a>
            <p class="subheading mb-2">14.1 Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.</p>
            <p class="par-1">All claims and disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or the use of the
                Services that cannot be resolved in small claims court will be resolved by binding arbitration on an
                individual basis (" <strong>Disputes</strong> "), except that you and Company are not required to
                arbitrate any
                dispute for enforcement or infringement of either party's Intellectual Property Rights (" <strong>Excluded
                    Disputes</strong> "). Any and all Disputes relating to, arising out of, or in any way in
                connection with your
                rights of privacy and publicity are not Excluded Disputes.</p>
            <p class="subheading mb-2">14.2 Arbitration Rules.</p>
            <p class="par-1">The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this
                dispute-resolution provision. Arbitration will be initiated through the American Arbitration
                Association ("AAA"). If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an
                alternative arbitral forum. The rules of the arbitral forum will govern all aspects of this
                arbitration, except to the extent those rules conflict with these Terms. The AAA Consumer
                Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the
                AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator. Any
                Disputes where the total amount sought is less than $10,000 USD may be resolved through binding
                non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For Disputes where the
                total amount sought is $10,000 USD or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the
                arbitral forum's rules. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any
                court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
            <p class="subheading mb-2">14.3 Additional Rules</p>
            <p class="par-1">If non-appearance arbitration is elected, the arbitration will be conducted by
                telephone, online, written submissions, or any combination of the three; the specific manner will be
                chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration will not involve any personal
                appearance by the parties or witnesses unless the parties mutually agree otherwise.</p>
            <p class="subheading mb-2">14.4 Authority of the Arbitrator.</p>
            <p class="par-1">The arbitrator will decide the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and the rights and
                liabilities, if any, of you and Company. The dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters
                or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions
                dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to award
                monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under
                applicable law, the arbitral forum's rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator will issue a written award
                and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is
                based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to
                award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the
                arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Company.</p>
            <p class="subheading mb-2">14.5 Waiver of Jury Trial.</p>
            <p class="par-1">YOU AND COMPANY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A
                TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, OTHER THAN IN RESPECT OF EXCLUDED DISPUTES. You and Company are
                instead electing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. In any litigation between you
                and Company over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS
                TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p>
            <p class="subheading mb-2">14.6 Waiver of Class</p>
            <p class="par-1">ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE
                ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE
                CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER
                CUSTOMER OR USER. If, however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or
                unenforceable, neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will
                be resolved in a court as set forth in Section 13(12) below.</p>
            <p class="subheading mb-2">14.7 Confidentiality.</p>
            <p class="par-1">No part of the procedures will be open to the public or the media. All evidence
                discovered or submitted at the hearing is confidential and may not be disclosed, except by written
                agreement of the parties, pursuant to court order, or unless required by law. Notwithstanding the
                foregoing, no party will be prevented from submitting to a court of law any information needed to
                enforce this arbitration agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or
                equitable relief.</p>
            <p class="subheading mb-2">14.8 Right to Waive.</p>
            <p class="par-1">Any rights and limitations set forth in this arbitration agreement may be waived by the
                party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver will not waive or affect any other portion of
                this arbitration agreement.</p>
            <p class="subheading mb-2">14.9 Opt-out.</p>
            <p class="par-1">You may opt out of this arbitration agreement. If you do so, neither you nor Company
                can force the other to arbitrate. To opt out, you must notify Company in writing no later than
                thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to this arbitration agreement. Your notice must
                include your name and address, your Company username and the email address you used to set up your
                Company account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt-out of this
                arbitration agreement. You must send your opt-out notice to Company's address published on the
                Services.</p>
            <p class="subheading mb-2">14.10 Small Claims Court.</p>
            <p class="par-1">Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Company may bring an individual action in
                small claims court.</p>
            <p class="subheading mb-2">14.11 Arbitration Agreement Survival.</p>
            <p class="par-1">This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with
                Company.</p>
            <p class="subheading mb-2">14.12 Venue for Excluded Disputes.</p>
            <p class="par-1">Excluded Disputes shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
                Israel, without regard to the principles of conflict of law therein. The parties consent to the
                exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Tel Aviv-Jaffa in respect of Excluded Disputes and hereby
                submit themselves to the jurisdiction of these courts.</p>
            <p class="subheading mb-2">14.13 U.N. Convention.</p>
            <p class="par-1">The application of the United Nations Convention of Contracts for the International
                Sale of Goods or other international laws is expressly excluded, whether the claim is in arbitration
